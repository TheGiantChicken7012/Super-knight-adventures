# Super Knight Adventures

Welcome to **Super Knight Adventures**!

This is a 2D game and **my very first project developed using the Godot Engine**. I created this game to learn about game mechanics, physics, and level design. I hope you enjoy playing it as much as I enjoyed making it!

## How to Download & Play

You can find the latest version for Windows and Linux in the [**Releases**](https://github.com/TheGiantChicken7012/Super-knight-adventures/releases) section.

### For Windows Users
The installation is very simple, but Windows might try to protect you because I am an indie developer without a paid license.

1. Download the `.zip` file for Windows.
2. Extract the folder.
3. Double-click on `Super Knight Adventures.exe`.
4. **If Windows Defender appears:**
   * You might see a blue window saying *"Windows protected your PC"*.
   * Click on **"More info"** (under the text).
   * Then click the **"Run anyway"** button.
5. Enjoy the game!

### For Linux Users
1. Download the file for Linux (usually a `.tar.gz` or `.zip`).
2. Extract the contents of the archive.
3. Open the folder and locate the file ending in `.x86_64`.
4. Run that file to start the game.
   * *Note: If it doesn't open, ensure the file has execution permissions (Right-click > Properties > Permissions > Allow executing file as program).*
